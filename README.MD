## How to Create a New Bot and Add the Token to Your Project

To get your Trading Journal Bot up and running, you need to create a new bot on Telegram using BotFather and configure it in your project. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Bot Using BotFather

1. **Open Telegram** and search for **BotFather** (the official bot for managing all Telegram bots).
2. **Start a chat** with BotFather by clicking on the `/start` button or typing `/start`.
3. To create a new bot, type the command `/newbot`.
4. **Name your bot** when prompted. This will be the display name of your bot.
5. **Choose a username** for your bot. The username must be unique and end with `bot` (e.g., `MyTradingJournalBot`).
6. After successful creation, BotFather will provide you with a **Bot Token**.

### Step 2: Add the Bot Token to Your Project

1. **Copy the Bot Token** provided by BotFather. This token is essential for authenticating your bot with the Telegram API.

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of your project (if it doesnâ€™t already exist).

3. Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with the actual token you received from BotFather:
    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
    ```

    Example:
    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjkLmNOPQrstUVwxyZ1234567
    ```

### Step 3: Run Your Bot

1. With the `.env` file set up, your bot is ready to run. You can start your bot using the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Your bot should now be connected to Telegram and ready to interact with users!
